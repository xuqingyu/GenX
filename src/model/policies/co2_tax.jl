	co2_cap(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)

This policy constraints mimics the CO$_2$ emissions cap and permit trading systems, allowing for emissions trading across each zone for which the cap applies. The constraint $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}$ can be flexibly defined for mass-based or rate-based emission limits for one or more model zones, where zones can trade CO$_2$ emissions permits and earn revenue based on their CO$_2$ allowance. Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment), the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO$_2$ price per tonne associated with the emissions target. Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO$_2$ price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.

The CO$_2$ emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways: a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO$_2$ emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2), b) a load-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO$_2$ per MWh of demand and c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO$_2$ per MWh of generation.

**Mass-based emissions constraint**

Mass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression. For each constraint, $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{mass}$, we define a set of zones $z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}$ that can trade CO$_2$ allowance. Input data for each constraint  $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{mass}$ requires the CO$_2$ allowance/ budget for each model zone, $\epsilon^{CO_{2}}_{z,p, mass}$, to be provided in terms of million metric tonnes. For every generator $y$, the parameter $\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2}$ reflects the specific $CO_2$ emission intensity in tCO$_2$/MWh associated with its operation.  The resulting constraint is given as:

```math
\begin{aligned}
    \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left(\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,z,t} \right)
   & \leq \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}} \epsilon^{CO_{2}}_{z,p, mass} \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{mass}
\end{aligned}
```

In the above constraint, we include both power discharge and charge term for each resource to account for the potential for CO$_2$ emissions (or removal when considering negative emissions technologies) associated with each step. Note that if a limit is applied to each zone separately, then the set $\mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}$ will contain only one zone with no possibility of trading. If a system-wide emission limit constraint is applied, then $\mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}$ will be equivalent to a set of all zones.

**Load-side rate-based emissions constraint**

We modify the right hand side of the above mass-based constraint, $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{load}$, to set emissions target based on a CO$_2$ emission rate limit in tCO$_2$/MWh $\times$ the total demand served in each zone. In the following constraint, total demand served takes into account non-served energy and storage related losses. Here, $\epsilon_{z,p,load}^{maxCO_2}$ denotes the emission limit in terms on tCO$_2$/MWh.

```math
\begin{aligned}
    \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,load}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left(\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,t,z} \right)
    \leq & \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,load}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}  \left(\epsilon_{z,p,load}^{CO_2} \times  \omega_{t} \times D_{z,t} \right) \\  + & \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,load}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{O}}  \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left(\epsilon_{z,p,load}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \left(\Pi_{y,t,z} - \Theta_{y,t,z} \right) \right) \\  - & \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,load}} \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S} } \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}  \left(\epsilon_{z,p,load}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Lambda_{s,z,t}\right) \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{load}
\end{aligned}
```

**Generator-side emissions rate-based constraint**

Similarly, a generation based emission constraint is defined by setting the emission limit based on the total generation times the carbon emission rate limit in tCO$_2$/MWh of the region. The resulting constraint is given as:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,gen}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} & \left(\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,t,z} \right) \\
    \leq \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,gen}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} & \left(\epsilon_{z,p,gen}^{CO_2} \times  \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,t,z} \right)  \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{gen}
\end{aligned}
```

Note that the generator-side rate-based constraint can be used to represent a fee-rebate (``feebate'') system: the dirty generators that emit above the bar ($\epsilon_{z,p,gen}^{maxCO_2}$) have to buy emission allowances from the emission regulator in the region $z$ where they are located; in the same vein, the clean generators get rebates from the emission regulator at an emission allowance price being the dual variable of the emissions rate constraint.
